# QueueMe

QueueMe is a mobile app that digitizes physical lines for service providers and clients. Instead of waiting around in-person, users can join a queue with a simple code and get notified when it's almost their turn. Whether at a clinic, restaurant, or student help desk, QueueMe reduces idle waiting and lets people take back their time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 **Code-Based Queue Creation**: Providers can generate a simple queue code for clients to join on the spot.
- 🙋 **Instant Join Flow**: Clients can enter a code, input basic info, and join the line in seconds.
- 📍 **Real-Time Queue Tracking**: Clients see their live position and estimated wait time.
- 🧩 **Clean, Minimal UI**: A fast and intuitive interface for both businesses and consumers.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: Hosted JSON object
- **Tools**: Git, Figma (for UI/UX)

## 🎯 Target Use Cases

QueueMe is designed for any walk-in service that suffers from inefficient line management:
- Clinics
- Campus service desks
- Salons
- Restaurants
- Government services

## 📈 Future Plans

We’re continuing to work on QueueMe post-hackathon and plan to implement:
- 🔒 Authentication for providers and clients
- 📱 Automated SMS notifications for improved accessibility
- 📊 Wait-time analytics powered by AI
- 🧱 API integration for external queueing platforms
